## Overview

Our work consists of a comprehensive study and implementation of a novel ATS system using state-of-the-art transformer models like T5, along with HuggingFace and OpusMT for efficient natural language understanding, processing, and translation. The ultimate goal is to create an effective, high-performing text summarization system that is both abstractive and efficient.
